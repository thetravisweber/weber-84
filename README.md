Web Based Graphing Calculator, designed to help me explore certain math principles, namely matrix transformations.

You can view a working version of it here: [Weber-84 hosted by Netlify](https://elaborate-pegasus-3533db.netlify.app/). (directions not included)

## Setup

Just clone the repo and load the index.html file in your favorite browser.

## Why use?

There is no good reason to use this over Desmos, I just wanted coding practice.
